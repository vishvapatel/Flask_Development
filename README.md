## Url Shortner
<h3>My first full stack web development website designed and written every pixel using <b>Flask Framework</b></h3>

  The name is <strong>Url Shortner</strong> because the webapp shortens the Urls for you. You have to upload a file and its code to shorten it or enter the desired URL to link to after entering your code with it.
